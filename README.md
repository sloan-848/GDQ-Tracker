# GDQ-Tracker
This is a small Proof of Concept iOS Application designed around the [Games Done Quick ](https://gamesdonequick.com) Speedrunning Marathons that allows users to keep up to date on the game schedule. This is a small app, yet it showcases important functionality such as:
- Scraping the SGDQ 2016 schedule dynamically
- Parsing the table to make intelligent decisions about what changes have happened to the data
- Correcting for timezone
- Displaying useful, pertenant information to the user in an efficient and somewhat pleasing way

## Future Goals
In the future, I hope to add a WatchOS component that adds Apple Watch functionality, in the form of an app and potentially a complication. 

My eventual goal would be to collaborate with the GDQ Staff and have this app be available to all watchers of GDQ events as a helpful tool to keep up with the schedule over the course of the week.
